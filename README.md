Boot.dev course #5 - Object Oriented Programming

Will be copy/pasting the main.py and main_test.py files for each part of the lesson to show
the baseline data that I am working with, and then add in my solutions.

Naming convention for files will be:   

main.py --- this is the version I have edited   

lesson-main.py --- this is the version provided by Boot.dev that needs edited in order to function   

main_test.py --- this is the testing script that judges whether my edits are successful or not   

console_output.md --- console output from main_test.py
